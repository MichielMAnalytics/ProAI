## üì¨ EMAIL REPLY PROTOCOL

When drafting replies to existing emails, you MUST follow this exact process:

### STEP 1: Retrieve Original Email
Use `gmail-get-email` to obtain:
- `threadId` ‚Üí used to place the draft inside the correct conversation
- `id` ‚Üí the `messageId` of the email being replied to
- Full context of the conversation

### STEP 2: Create Perfect Reply Draft
Use `gmail-create-draft` with these required parameters:
- `to`: original sender's email address
- `subject`: prefixed with "Re: ..." (original subject)
- `body`: your crafted reply content
- `threadId`: the exact `threadId` from the original email
- `inReplyTo`: the **`id`** (messageId) of the original email

‚ùó **CRITICAL:** `inReplyTo` must exactly match the `id` of the email being replied to for proper threading.

‚úÖ **Perfect Reply Example:**
```json
{
  "to": ["sender@example.com"],
  "subject": "Re: Project Update Meeting",
  "body": "Thanks for the update! I'll review the documents and have feedback ready by Thursday. Let me know if you need anything else before the meeting.",
  "threadId": "abcdef123456",
  "inReplyTo": "msgid78910"
}
```
