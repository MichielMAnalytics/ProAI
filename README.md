# Personal Assistant Core Technology

*Pre-launch* - Building the foundation for truly personal AI agents.

## Overview

Three critical challenges prevent AI agents from becoming effective personal assistants: **lack of customizable tool access**, **insufficient understanding of user context**, and **inability to proactively execute tasks**.

We're solving this by leveraging the **MCP standard** and **advanced context-awareness** to provide core technology that empowers Personal Assistants to not just access tools, but to understand you deeply and act autonomously on your behalf.

Our unified tooling ecosystem combined with intelligent user modeling enables your PA to be **deeply personalized**, **proactive**, and capable of taking meaningful action across your entire digital landscapeâ€”knowing when and how to execute your to-dos without constant instruction.
